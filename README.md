# USB_Access_Control

This was my CSE323 (Operating system design) course's project.
Here I demonstrated how you can control access to USB devices via a finger system on windows machine.
Companies can use such a system to restrict access to unauthorized USB devices in their systems and protect their employees from being victims of attacks such as drop drive hacks.
